# Welcome

This is a collection of Python Jupyter notebooks, complementing various aspects of content covered in the Mathematics for Application Development 2 course MAT202, as part of the undergraduate Computer Games Application Design (CGAD) students at Abertay University.

MAT202 aims to give you an understanding of the mathematics that underpins a range of applications in CGAD. The routines demonstrated here illustrate how Python (and other computational languages) can be used to see this mathematics in action. 

The MAT202 examination will evaluate your understanding of this mathematics, formulating solutions to mathematical problems using pen and paper. These notebooks and routines do *NOT* replace the mathematical approaches shown in the lectures, and should not be used in the exam under any circumstances. See    
[MAT202 MyLearningSpace pages](https://mylearningspace.abertay.ac.uk/d2l/home/32285) for more information related to the MAT202 course.
