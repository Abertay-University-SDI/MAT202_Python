    "## General introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook contains examples of simple Python commands and programs. These examples aim to enhance understanding of the dynamics component of MAT201. \n",
    "Students can use Python to check their answers and visually see the mathematics in action. More broadly, a wide knowledge and ability to use other programming languages may help with problem solving and employability. \n",

    "Python is an open-source programming language used extensively around the world. It is also vital for carrying out Scientific Computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook comprises of a series of Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "Jupyter and python can be launched through the Anaconda data science platform on an individual machine. Anaconda can be downloaded here:\n",
    "\n",
    "[https://www.anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks combines sections of markdown text (which can include mathematical expressions) with executable elements of (Python) code. The executable elements appear in this workbook as grey boxes; when the workbook was created, *all* code elements were ran, and any output from them is seen directly below them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big advantage of this workbook is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**You can download each notebook to your computer or to the cloud and run all the code elements for yourself!**\n",
    "\n",
    "I encourage you to read through each page of the workbook, then choose one of two options:\n",

    "1.   click the rocket symbol  at the top of the page and launch the page in Google Colab.\n",
    "2.   click the arrow symbol  at the top of the page, and download the notebook as a '.ipynb' file, in order to run the examples using jupyter-notebook.\n",

    "I recommend using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), unless you are confident that you have installed anaconda and jupyter notebook correctly on your machine. You will need a Google account to perform cloud computing, but executing the code elements is nearly identical in both Jupyter and Colab."
