# MAT202 Python workbook

These pages contain Python notebooks. These notebooks augment lectures/topics in the MAT202 "Mathematics for Application Development 2" undergraduate lecture course, part of Abertay University's Computer Games Application Development (BSc) degree programme.

These notebooks illustrate specific mathematical concepts, implemented in the Python coding language. Python is capable of handling and visualing specific mathematical problems with ease, so these notebooks complement the formal mathematics taught in lectures. The aim is to show how the mathematics can be solved using computer code, or as an aid to visualise the content taught in lectures. These pages are not to be used in examinations, and are not currently formally assessed. A brief introduction to the Python progamming language is given at the beginning of the workbook.

All code was authored and written by Dr James Threlfall based on problems proposed in workbook or his own lectures and tutorials carried out in MAT202 (2024).
