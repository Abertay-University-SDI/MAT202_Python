# Summary

Thanks for viewing the Python notebooks. They aim to provide another way to think about the mathematics content taught in MAT202, with a view to implementation in code, or visualise concepts taught in lectures. I hope that these interactive tools have helped you to understand the mathematics and how it is used in Computer Games Application Development. 

These notebooks are entirely my own initiative. I can only continue to make them for maths courses if they help students. I would greatly appreciate feedback, good and bad, in order to improve them further! Your feedback is vital! Please complete the [feedback

Thank You!
